For a subject_id / patient do the following:

Extract ICU intime and outtime from clinical DB;

list_of_numeric_recordings =  extract the names of the numeric recordings i.e.'___n' files for this subject_id from the waveform database.

For each numeric recording in list_of_numeric_recordings:
	Extract signal names recorded in it ;
	Calculate the record start time and end time from the numeric recording;
	
	if all 6 required signals i.e.(HR , RESP, SPO2, ABP SYS, ABP DIAS, ABP MEAN) exists, then:
		if record start and end time overlaps with ICU intime and outtime, then:
			Consider this record;
			
			Extract all 6 signals data from the recording according to their indexes;
			
			If this is the first recording for that patient:
					if recording starts sometime after the ICU intime, then:
						insert nulls between the icu intime and recording starttime;
						append the extracted 6 signals data to the main dataframe;
					 
					else:
						insert the extracted 6 signals data to the main dataframe;
				
					if the sampling frequency is per second,then:
						convert the data into per minute by taking average for per 60 seconds data;
					else when the sampling frequency is per minute,then:
						do nothing;
				
		
			else (i.e. when this is not the first recording for that patient):
					if there is some gap between 1st / previous recoding end time and the current recording startime, then:
						insert nulls to for that gap time;
						append the extracted 6 signals data to the main dataframe;
					else:
						append the extracted 6 signals data to the main dataframe;
				
					if the sampling frequency is per second,then:
						convert the data into per minute by taking average for per 60 seconds data;
					else when the sampling frequency is per minute,then:
						do nothing;
					
		
	
	When all the recordings i.e. __n files have been checked and the 6 signals data has been extracted fo the following:
		

	if last recording ended sometime  before the ICU outtime, then:
		insert nulls between the record end time and ICU outtime at the end ;
	else:
		do nothing;
